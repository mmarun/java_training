For very small applications earlier or even today people used to save data on a file.
On your local machine you are going to save the data..

Earlier programs during java 1.0 times the user information was stored on files.
The program used to read a file at the start during initialization and during the application exit it would save information on the file.

During that time Java SCJP - Sun certified Java Professional...
1995 - 2000 - The file I/O  programming used to have a lot of weightage in SJCP..

Databases became cheaper during this time. A lot of new companies started their db products.

The weightage for file handling in SCJP was reduced..

Advantages of file handling -
 
1. Program became simple.
2. You can copy your file and move the the file from one machine to another.
3. Good to use on low number of records.

Disadvantage -
1. Security is lost
2. For large number of records it becomes unscalable
3. Very hard to differentiate between CREATE and Update..

Better options for file handling -

Licensed and are sold (Proprietory databases)

1. Microsoft Access - This was a microsoft small database which was good to use for  10000-15000
2. Beyond the range the performance will go down..

Advantage:
Very cheap (By the standards at that time).

-----------------------------------------------

Sybase -
Was good wood with few million or so records and was more expensive that access but less expensive than Oracle..
Microsoft took over the company and it was called Microsoft Sql server.. Mid 2000's or last yearsr in the decade for 2000..

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Oracle ---

This as the most costly database during that time. Even today companies which have billions of records prefer using oracle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open source database.

So they started a project called My - SQL. (My was the name of the daughter of a Swedish Lead developer)..
They made it open-source..

It is much better than Access, some what inferior to  MS-SQL. But it is open source.
If you plan to maintain a few million records then My-SQL is preferred.

Sun microsystems was sold to oracle in 2008-2010..

This project My-SQL is now maintained by Oracle.


Advantages -
1. Open source.
2. Light weight.
3. User friendly

4. good UI tools are available

Disadvantages:
1. Not optimal for huge number of records and tables.
