Since yesterday Git hub has changed its policy.
We can no longer use git hub account username and Password to push the changes.
You need to create a private key at 
Git Hub -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Git bash -> Generate new token

Copy that token and save that to a file.

Use that token as a password going forward..
Control Panel -> User Account -> Credential Manager -> GitHub -> Edit -> Update Password
