Welcome to the first session for Java.

In this session we are going to cover the topics below:

1. History of Java.
2. Future of Java.
3. Basic Tools and installations required for Java.
4. A demo program.

History of Java -

James Gosling is the architect / Designer of the Java Programming language.
They started working on Java in 1991 and were planning to use it within television cable system.
The project name for it was Oak. Later they changed its name to Green but it was finally released as Java in 1996 after a coffee type 
coming from Java Islands in Indonesia.

It provided an alternative to C, C++ programming language --
There were many different compilers for C, C Plus Plus (i as C++ or Cpp) 

Advantages of Java over C, C++:

There were different compilers for Cpp in 1990's. Each of the compiler created exe in custom format type of exe which at times was not compatible on all machines.
Meaning if you take copy an exe file from X machine and try to run it on a different machine say Y with slightly different configuration there was a high possibility 
that you would get errors. 
Some libraries did not play well with some other libraries and there was little gaurantee that software would run as 
expected leading to long hours being wasted 
in identifying the underlying issues.

Imagine you have brought a software for 1200 Rs a year for 30 PCs. Your are trying to get it installed on all 30 machines but it
correctly installs only on 24 machines and does not run of remaining n6. Now your engineers and the engineers from the software company are spending time to identify the root cause.
It is simply frustating. Who bears the cost of those 6 machine failure, who pays for that failure. You have brought expensive machines (Back then even hardware was pretty costly)
here we are talking about servers.

Even companies like Symantec (Norton) had instances where every 1 out of 5 customers came asking for a refund due to failed installation of their antivirus.
We are talking about software industry back in 1998-2004 period..

In order to get rid of this problem Java guys came up with a term called as Write Once, Run always (WORA).
Here your java executable is only byte code which is understood by JRE and all the intricasies of the hardware (OS) is handled by the Java Platform. 
If JRE is installed successfully your software will run successfully.

That was a big advantage.

Other advantage was platform independence - Meaning your Jar will run on Windows, Unix, Linux, Solaris, etc..

That made Java a huge success in 1997-1998. 
There were advertisements in news papers in Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore which said (Java Shika, Americala Java - 1 month course) - Learn Java Go to America..
A lot of people were able to go there, smart ones are still there the below average ones had to return after the DOT COM Bust in US some where in 2000 - 2001..

Future of Java:
Currently Java is the most dominant technology in the open source software space.
It is used by a large number of organisations like Citibank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays,...  in a lot of different areas.

1. Java with Spring Boot and Hibernate is used extensively in order to create REST Api's with a server like
 Tomcat.
2. Java 8 with Spring boot is used in order to create a large number of microservices for Microservices architecture.
3. Andriod development for most of its part was done in Java.
4. You can do IOT development with Java.

Java being open source there are a large number of libraries and tooling available in it.


Assignments for the session-

1. Install Chocolatey package manager.
2. Install some software using the chocolatey package manager.
