Create an employee Class with members empId, empName, empDepartment, empSalary...

Use Lombok to configure constructors, getters and setters.

Default natural sorting in Comparable must be by empName

Customized comparator should sort by Salary in descending order.. (The people who have more salary are more important. :))

Write Unit tests to check if this implementation is working correctly -- VERY IMPORTANT...


Use TreeSet..

---Tomorrow we will cover HashSet, HashMap, HashTable,etc...

------ Collections will be complete..
