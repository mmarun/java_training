We are now going to focus on the Java language and its features
It is also commonly known as Core Java. 
We are going to use Java 8 SDK as it has most industry usage today.
We will only use Java 8 going forward so please set up your Intellij environment accordingly.

The topics will be structured as below:

1. Java Language basic fundamentals like Keywords, Identifiers etc..
2.Introduction to DataTypes and Java numercial classes.
3. Boxing and Unboxing
4. Java access specifiers 
5. Assignments and Operators in Java
6. Program flow control 
7. Exception Handling

We will be quickly covering these topics in 2 -3  sessions. 
Further topics will be discussed later.



DETAILS BELOW:

1. Flow Control (will control your program flow) (default, 
2. Class defination and structure (class, interface, implements, extends, enum)
3. Data Types (char, int, double, float, etc)
4. Exeception Handling. (try, catch, finally)
5. Object related keywords. (new, super, this)
6. Access specifiers or Modifiers ( public, private, static, protected, abstract, native, synchronized) 



bit
8 bits you get one byte..
1024bytes is one kilo byte..

byte -128 to 127..
you also need to take 0 into consideration.

short 2 bytes 
-2^15 to +2^15 -1
-32768 to 32767

int 4 bytes 
-2^31 to 2^31 -1
214crores

long 8 bytes 
-2^63 to 2^63-1

======

float - 5-6 decimal points (4 bytes )
double - 15-16 decimal points  (8 bytes)

=====================
char - 2 bytes (unicode) - 65 thousand symbols..

boolean - false or true.. 
1bit.. -
