JDBC API
Java Database connectivity API
 
Any language like DotNet, Cpp, Java, Python, etc.. 
In order to connect to the database you need Database driver. 
Java Mysql driver
Java Oracle driver.

Make a connection - Connection string - Database instance, Database name, username and Password..,
Open connection..

Using dotnet Database adapter.
Jdbc command.. 

Table is already created.. (DML operations) (Medium security)..
CRUD - Create, Update, Read and Delete.

DDL is like create table, alter table, delete table, drop table. These operations are DDL operations. (High security)


SQL injection attacks..

JDBC was tough to follow..

ORM frameworks..
Object relational mapping.. (ORM) frameworks..
Java you are using objects.. you want to save this object into the database. 
They work as a bridge between your table or database and the java application..

ORM frameworks - For java env you have Hibernate (80%), Toplink (10%), iBatis etc.. 
ORM frameworks for DotNet - EntityFramework, Dapper (micro ORM)..

Benefits- Every db has little variation in syntax. 

Connection string has paramters like
Database instance, Database name, username and Password.. you configure this in a properties like..
Log4j  you had a properties file..
jpaproperties, or application.properties 
 
Java Persistance API...
Hibernate became very popular.. Some other vendors also wanted to provide ORM functionality..

Hibernate follows Java Persistance API.
MyBatis/IBatis follows that.
Toplink also follows that..

Spring Data JPA..
It removed the complexity of Hibernate and started to provide easier way for functionality to access the database.

If you are using hibernate if you need some functionality you would need 30 days of work.
Using spring data jpa you can get it done within 10 days .
